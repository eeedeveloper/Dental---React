Having been introduced to Connor from Bryant Dental, we were 100% sure that we are going to get the right product. Facial scan- all measurements taken professionally, 8- 10 weeks later our custom made loupes arrived in a very smart looking case. I have used them for 1 month now and I have a massive improvement in my ability to carry out intricate procedures. I use them daily and have no headaches or eye strain after use. I can not thank the team at Bryant Dental for changing my experience with loupes. Great service before and after, and happy to recommend them to any dentist, hygienist or technician.- Anyone practising dentistry without loupes is missing the smaller picture!',

I use them for everything and they are lighter than my old 2.5x. Almost every dentist in our practice now uses bryant loupes, and were still working on the owner.", // eslint-disable-line

The clarity of the lens and the FOV is brilliant. I have gone straight in for the 5X magnification and had no issues tolerating them due to the FOV.
