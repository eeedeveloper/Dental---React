      Precision dichroic composite filter which prevents composite
      curing by specifically cutting out any wavelength of light
      that cures composite – nothing more. This means the light you
      see whilst the filter is on is a pale yellow and not a dark
      orange, allowing enhanced depth perception and finer control
      over aesthetic work. The filter itself is held in place with 6
      neodymium magnets which offer beautifully smooth transitions
      via a screwless design.

        <p>
          CRI (Colour Rendering Index), as per the International Commission on
          Illumination (CIE), is the Effect of an illuminant on the colour
          appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with
          their colour appearance under a reference illuminant.
        </p>

        <p>
          A high CRI is not usually recommended except for very specific
          surgical applications. As the majority of dental lighting is now
          powered by LEDs, the corrected colour temperature is far more
          significant than CRI.
        </p>

        <p>
          CRI does not lend itself to LED lighting particularly well. This is
          because it does not measure all the colours in a spectrum, instead
          it’s the average of 8 test colours. LEDs are not usually full spectrum
          light sources and therefore high CRIs could actually render colours
          more poorly than lower CRI LEDs. <br />
